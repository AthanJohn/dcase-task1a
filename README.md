This project is divided by 3 tasks in Matlab. The main objective of the first task is the understanding of the need for diversity in digital wireless communication systems with fading. The main objective of the second task is the understanding of using multiple antennas for diversity but also for spatial multiplexing. And the main objective of the third task is the understanding of OFDM. In all tasks, we had to display a graph of BER(Bit Error Rate) with specific SNR(Signal-to-Noise Ratio) values.
