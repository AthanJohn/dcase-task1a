The task of this project is to estimate the velocity of a vehicle (transmitter) from another vehicle (receiver) with constant velocity. The first vehicle transmits a wireless signal to the second. As the first vehicle moves, the second collects continually y measurements (y=h*x+w, h: channel with path loss and Rayleigh fading, x: wireless signal, w: noise) for a specific period. I used linear estimator (LMMSE). The final result is a graph, which shows how MSE (Mean Square Error) decreases as much as the SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) increases.
